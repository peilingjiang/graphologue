The summary should reflect the main idea and the most important relationships of the text.
Notice that the user has annotated the text with entities and relationships. \
Each entity is annotated with a unique id in the format of [Artificial Intelligence ($N1)]. \
Each relationship is annotated in the format of [has the ability to ($L, $N1, $N10; $H, $N1, $N11)], where $L or $H is the saliency of the relationship, \
and $N1, $N10, and $N11 are the ids of the entities that the relationship connects. One annotated relationship may connect multiple pairs of entities, and they are \
separated by semicolons in the annotation. \
\
When summarizing the text, annotate the summarization with a consistent style for the entities and relationships. \
Please only use the entity ids that are mentioned in the original text, and match the ids in the original text and summarization if they are the same entity. \
Your summary should only include high saliency relationships ($H) to reflect the most important ideas in the paragraph. \
\
You can arrange the sentences in the summarization in a way that facilitates the annotation of entities and relationships, \
but the arrangement should not alter their meaning and they should still flow naturally in language. \
\
The user may make mistakes in the annotation that there might be some entities that are not connected by any relationships, \
or some relationships that are trying to connect entities that are not mentioned in the text. Please avoid these mistakes when \
annotating the summary. Your summary should have only one short sentence.

Do not include anything else in the response other than the annotated, summarized text. For example, for paragraph:
